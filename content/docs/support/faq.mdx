  <Accordion title="What is Voux used for?">
    Voux is a self-hosted view counter with a small analytics dashboard. It is meant for tracking page views without heavy analytics.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How does Voux count views?">
    Voux supports two counting modes.  
&bull; **Unique** uses the visitor **IP** to avoid duplicate hits.  
&bull; **Every-visit** counts every request, including page refreshes, and always stores **IPs**, hits are only limited when a throttle is enabled, not like unique mode.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="When should I use Unique vs Every-visit?">
  Use **Unique** if you want to avoid counting repeat views from the same visitor.  
  Use **Every-visit** if you want to count all hits, including refreshes or repeated visits.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Does Voux use cookies or track users across sites?">
    **No.** Voux does not use cookies or cross-site tracking. It only tracks views per counter.
  </Accordion>

    **Yes.** Voux is fully self-hosted. You run it on your own server.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What kind of analytics does Voux provide?">
    Voux provides basic analytics related to views, such as counts and simple breakdowns. It is not meant to replace full analytics platforms.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I use Voux on multiple websites?">
    **Yes.** You can create multiple counters and use them across different websites or pages.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Where is Voux data stored?">
    All data is stored locally on your server in Voux's database.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What happens if my server goes down?">
    Views are not counted while the server is offline. Once it is back up, everything continues normally.
  </Accordion>
