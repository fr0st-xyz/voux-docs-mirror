## What is Voux?

**Voux** <span className='text-fd-muted-foreground text-sm'>(voo)</span> is a self hosted view counter for blogs and websites, 
built to show view counts and simple stats without turning into a full analytics platform.

## Philosophy

**Voux** is built to be useful without getting in the way. If all you need is a view count, it should not be complicated.

## Why I built it

There were no good free hit counters left, so I decided to make my own. 
A long time ago there was a site called **Cutercounter** where you could make simple unique-visit counters, but it shut down. 
So I switched to **freehitcounters.org** for a while, but I wanted something I could control myself. If a service goes down or changes, 
I don't want to depend on it. So I built **Voux** to be my own version that anyone can run and trust, 
especially for people who do not know how to build unique visitor counters or complicated backends and just want something simple that works.

## When to use Voux

Use Voux if you want a simple counter without giving your traffic data to someone else.

It's good for:

- **Personal blogs**
- **Indie websites**
- **Small projects that just need a view counter**
