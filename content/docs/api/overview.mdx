The **Voux API** lets you access your counters and data from outside the dashboard, 
and all responses are returned in `JSON` format.

If you only use the dashboard, you do not need the API.
Use the API if you want to connect Voux to your own app, script, or service.


## API endpoint

The Voux API is available at the `/api` path of your instance.

Example:
- Voux instance: http://localhost:8787
- API base: http://localhost:8787/api

## Endpoint access levels

As you read the documentation, some endpoints are marked with labels like `[Admin]`, `[Member]`, `[Key]`, or `[Public]`.

These labels show who is allowed to access that endpoint.

- **[Admin]**  
  Requires an authenticated session.  
  You must be logged in, either from the dashboard or by sending session cookies (for example when using **curl**).

- **[Member]**  
  Requires an authenticated session.  
  You must be logged in as a member. Access is limited to your own counters and data.

- **[Key]**  
  Can be accessed using an API key sent in the `X-Voux-Key` header.  
  No login or cookies are required.

- **[Public]**  
  No authentication required.  
  Anyone can access these endpoints.

In short:
- **Admin** = logged in session (cookies)
- **Member** = logged in member session (cookies)
- **Key** = API key
- **Public** = open to everyone
