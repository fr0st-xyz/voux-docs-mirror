## Overview


Voux is configured using environment variables defined in the `.env` file.

Some options can be changed later from `/settings`, while others are only read when the server starts.


| Name | Default | What it does |
| ---- | -------- | ------------ |
| `PORT` | `8787` | The web server port number. |
| `PUBLIC_BASE_URL` | based on request | Lets you set a fixed site URL (like `https://counter.yourdomain.com`). |
| `ADMIN_USERNAME` | `admin` | Username for the first admin account. |
| `ADMIN_PASSWORD` | `change-this-password` | Password for the first admin account. |
| `PRIVATE_MODE` | `false` | If `true`, only users can create new counters. |
| `ADMIN_PAGE_SIZE` | `5` | How many counters show on each page in the admin panel. |
| `USERS_PAGE_SIZE` | `4` | How many users show on each page in the users list. |
| `SHOW_PUBLIC_GUIDES` | `true` | Controls if public guide cards are shown on the main page. |
| `DEFAULT_ALLOWED_MODES` | `unique,unlimited` | Comma-separated list of modes to allow (`unique`, `unlimited`) for counters. You can change it later in the dashboard. |
| `COUNTER_CREATE_LIMIT` | `5` | How many counters a single IP can create before hitting the one-minute cooldown. |
| `COUNTER_CREATE_WINDOW_MS` | `60000` | Window length (in ms) for the above limit. Leave it alone unless you need a different window. |
| `INACTIVE_DAYS_THRESHOLD` | `30` | Days with no hits before a counter shows an "Inactive" badge in the dashboard. |
| `BRAND_NAME` | `Voux` | Default display name (used in titles, hero text). You can override it in `/settings`. |
| `HOME_TITLE` | `Voux · Simple Free & Open Source Hit Counter...` | The homepage `<title>` tag value. Editable in settings. |
| `UNLIMITED_THROTTLE_SECONDS` | `0` | Seconds to wait before counting the same IP again in "Every visit" mode. `0` disables throttling. Applies only on first boot, once `data/config.json` exists, update the throttle from `/settings` or edit that file (`config.json`) (deleting it will regenerate from `.env`). |
| `DEV_MODE` | `development` | Use `development` in `.env` to serve HTML/JS/CSS with `no-store` caching. |
| `TRUST_PROXY` | `loopback` | Tells Voux how to detect the real visitor IP when something like Cloudflare, Nginx, Caddy, or a tunnel is in front of it. If your proxy sends traffic to `localhost` (for example `127.0.0.1:3000`), use `loopback` **(which is the default)**. If it sends traffic using another internal IP like `172.x.x.x` (common in Docker or multi-server setups), use `1`. Use `false` only if Voux is directly exposed to the internet with no proxy at all. |
