## Overview

The counter is the main feature of **Voux**. It simply counts views.

You can create a counter either from the main page **(if the instance is public)** or from the dashboard if you are logged in.

When creating a counter, you can choose between `2` modes:

---

### Unique visitors

**This mode counts only one visit per IP.**

If the same IP visits the page again, it will not increase the counter.
This is useful if you want something closer to **"real"** visitors.

---

### Every-visit

**This mode counts every page load.**

Refreshing the page will increase the counter each time, depending on the throttle setting.
By default, the throttle is `0s`, meaning every refresh counts.

You can think of this like an old-school hit counter from early web days.

---

After creating a counter, Voux gives you both an **embed script** and an **SVG embed**.
Once you place it on your website, views will start counting automatically.

<strong>From the dashboard, you can also edit counters, add notes, and use filters to manage them.</strong>

---

## Styling script embeds

Styling your counter with **Voux** is super simple.  
All you need to do is wrap the embed inside an element.

Here is a basic example using a `<span>`:

```html title="HTML"
<span class="counter-widget">
  <!-- replace this with your counter script -->
  <script async src="https://your-domain/embed/abc123.js"></script>
</span>
```

Once that is in place, you can style it however you want using normal CSS.

Here is a simple example that centers the counter on the screen and makes the text black:

```css title="CSS"
.counter-widget {
  position: fixed;
  top: 50%;
  left: 50%;
  transform: translate(-50%, -50%);
  text-align: center;
  color: black;
  font-weight: 600;
  font-size: 3rem;
  font-family: system-ui, sans-serif;
}
```

That is it. Your counter is now styled and ready to use.
You can change the **font**, **colors**, **size**, or **layout** however you like.

## Styling SVGs embeds

Voux also provides an **SVG embed** for cases where you cannot use **JavaScript**, 
such as **READMEs**, **Markdown files**, or **restricted platforms**.

```html
<img src="https://your-domain/embed/abc123.svg" alt="Voux counter">
```

You can also customize the **SVG** by passing **parameters** in the `URL` query string:

```html
<img src="https://your-domain/embed/abc123.svg?bg=F54927&color=ffffff" alt="Voux counter">
```

## SVGs in documentation

Some documentation pages **do not allow JavaScript**, for example when writing in `MDX` or other restricted formats. In these cases, SVG embeds are used instead.

Because documentation pages are served without **image proxy caching**, Voux can access real visitor IPs, so Unique Visitor mode works correctly.

| Mode               | Behavior                         | Example                                                                  |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 👤 Unique visitors | Supported                        | ✅ |
| 🔁 Every visit | Supported and updates on refresh | ✅ |

And... On **[GitHub](https://github.com/QuintixLabs/Voux?tab=readme-ov-file#-svg-counters-on-github)**, **Unique Visitors** are not available due to image proxy caching. `:(`
