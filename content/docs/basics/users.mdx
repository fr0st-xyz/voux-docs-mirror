## Overview

The **Users** page lets you create accounts for people you trust and control what they can do inside your Voux instance.

You can add new users, assign roles, and manage existing accounts from here.

---

## User roles

Voux has **3** user roles.


### 1. Owner
The Owner is the first account created on the instance.
- There is only one Owner
- The Owner has full access to everything
- The Owner has the same permissions as an Admin

**The Owner role only shows who owns the instance.**

---

### 2. Admin
Admins help manage the instance.
They can:
- Create, edit, and delete any counter
- Change instance settings
- Create and manage users
- Access backups and advanced features

**Admins have the same permissions as the Owner, but cannot delete the Owner.**

---

### 3. Member

Members have limited access. They can:
- Create counters
- Manage **only their own** counters
- Download backups for their own counters only

**They cannot:**
- Change instance settings
- Manage other users
- Access counters they do not own

**This is useful if you want to let others use Voux without giving them full control.**

---

## Admin permissions

Admin permissions control what admins are allowed to do.

### Runtime settings
**Allows admins to change how things work at runtime.**

### Branding
**Allows admins to change names, titles, and visual settings.**

### API keys
**Allows admins to create and manage API keys.**

### Users
**Allows admins to create, edit, and remove users.**

### Danger actions
**Allows admins to manage and delete any counter.**

<Callout title="Warning" type="warning">
This permission allows **deleting data**.
Admins with this enabled **can manage and delete counters permanently**.
</Callout>


You can set these permissions in `2` ways:

---

#### 1. Global admin defaults
Set default permissions that apply to all admins.
This controls what every admin can access by default.

#### 2. Per-user permissions
You can set permissions per admin.
These override the defaults.

---

## Creating a user

To create a new user:
1. Enter a **username**
2. <small>(Optional)</small> set a **display name**
3. Choose a **role**
4. Set a **password**
5. Click **Create user**

The new user can log in immediately using the credentials you set.

## When to use multiple users

Multiple users are useful if:
- You run a shared Voux instance
- Different people manage their own websites
- You want to avoid sharing a single admin account
