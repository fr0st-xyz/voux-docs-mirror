title: 📦 Manual Installation
description: Install Voux with Node.js.
---

---

## Requirements
- [git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) 22/23
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) **(comes with Node)**
- [fnm](https://github.com/Schniz/fnm)



## Building / Running

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash title="Terminal"
git clone https://github.com/QuintixLabs/Voux.git
cd Voux
```

Make sure you are running Node.js 22. If you use [fnm](https://github.com/Schniz/fnm) :

```bash title="Terminal"
fnm install 22
fnm use 22
node -v
```
This should print something like: `v22.x.x`

### 2. Install dependencies
```bash title="Terminal"
npm install
```

### 3. Create your .env file
```bash title="Terminal"
cp .env.example .env
```
<Callout title="Read this!" type="warning">
Open `.env` and set your settings. This is where you configure your **admin login**, **site URL**, **port**, and **other options**. 
You must set `ADMIN_USERNAME` + `ADMIN_PASSWORD` before running the server.
<p />
If you run **Voux** on a public domain, set `PUBLIC_BASE_URL` to your full URL (for example, https://your-domain.com) so embeds and previews use the correct **HTTPS** address. If you want a development setup, add `DEV_MODE=development`. 
</Callout>

### 4. Start Voux


```bash title="Terminal" tab="Development"
npm run dev
```

```bash title="Terminal" tab="Production"
npm start
```

By default, both commands run at: http://localhost:8787. You can change this by setting the **PORT** value in `.env`

During development, set `NODE_ENV=development` in your `.env` to serve **HTML/JS/CSS** with `no-store` caching.
